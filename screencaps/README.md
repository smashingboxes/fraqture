# How to add a screencap

1. Make sure the last two parameters of your drawing are `[800 500] []`
 - eg `(def drawing (Drawing. "Drag Glitch" setup update-state draw-state exit? [800 500] []))`
2. Get a screencapture program that supports gifs. A good one is [GifGrabber](http://www.gifgrabber.com/).
3. Record the animation for about 15 seconds.
4. Add the gif file to this directory
5. Add an image link to it in the main readme
