# How to add a screencap

1. Make sure the last two parameters of your drawing are `[800 500] []`
 - eg `(def drawing (Drawing. "Drag Glitch" setup update-state draw-state [800 500] []))`
2. Get a screencapture program that supports gifs. A good one is [GifGrabber](http://www.gifgrabber.com/).
3. Record the animation for about 15 seconds.
4. Upload the gif to imgur.
5. Add an image link to it in the main readme. Be sure to get the direct link, with a `.gif` extension.
